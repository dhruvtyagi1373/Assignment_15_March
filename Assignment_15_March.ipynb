Such “anomalous” behaviour typically translates to some kind of a problem like a credit card fraud, failing machine in a server, a cyber attack, etc.\n",
    "This method(Unsupervised Learning) does require any training data and instead assumes two things about the data ie Only a small percentage of data is anomalous and Any anomaly is statistically different from the normal samples. Based on the above assumptions, the data is then clustered using a similarity measure and the data points which are far off from the cluster are considered to be anomalies."
